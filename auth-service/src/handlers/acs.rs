//! ACS: resolve the SAML artifact into validated claims and hand off to the
//! embedding application.
//!
//! Every failure maps to a small `AuthFailure`, and the embedding application
//! renders the user-facing page (TVS T3/L10) directly on the ACS response. The
//! technical detail is logged at the failure site. The response is marked
//! `no-store` and `no-referrer`, so the one-time `SAMLart` in the ACS query is
//! neither cached nor leaked via `Referer`. What remains in the address bar is
//! useless on its own: an artifact is consumed at the RD the first time it is
//! resolved, and one that never was can only be accepted together with the flow
//! cookie bound to its AuthnRequest, whose ID only ever travelled in the signed
//! POST body.
//!
//! Whether a failure also ends the local session (TVS L10) depends on how far
//! the callback got, see [`Rejection`].
