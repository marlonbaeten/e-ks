//! SAML 2.0 Service Provider for the Dutch TVS *Routeringsdienst*.
//!
//! This crate implements the **DV (Dienstverlener / Service Provider)** side of
//! the *Koppelvlakspecificatie eID SAML v4.4* interface, talking to the TVS RD
//! (the IdP). A non-authoritative extract of the requirements this code targets
//! lives in `eid-saml-4.4-requirements.md` next to this crate; `§` references in
//! the source point at it (and, where noted, at the OASIS `saml-*-2.0-os` specs
//! and the TVS "Checklist Testen").
//!
//! # What it does
//!
//! It is consumed by an embedding application, which mounts [`router`] (the
//! protocol endpoints) plus [`handle_login`]/[`handle_logout`] on login/logout
//! routes of its own choosing:
//!
//! - `/login` (embedder-mounted [`handle_login`]): start SSO: build a signed
//!   AuthnRequest (§7.3) and auto-POST it to the RD SSO endpoint (HTTP-POST
//!   binding, §3.1.1).
//! - `GET  /saml/sp/acs`: Assertion Consumer Service: receive the artifact
//!   (§7.4), resolve it over the mTLS SOAP back-channel (§7.5, §9.4), and validate the
//!   ArtifactResponse, Response, then Assertion (§7.6).
//! - `GET  /login/error`: query-clean landing page for a failed authentication.
//! - `GET  /saml/sp/metadata`: serve the signed DV SP metadata (§8.3).
//! - `/logout` (embedder-mounted [`handle_logout`]) + `POST /saml/sp/logout`:
//!   SP-initiated logout (§7.7, §3.1.1.1).
//! - `GET  /saml/sp/autosubmit.js`: the script the HTTP-POST binding page submits.
//!
//! The embedding application supplies an [`AuthConfig`](config::AuthConfig) and implements
//! [`AuthState`] (create a session on login, tear it down on logout); all SAML
//! state (keys, the verified RD descriptor, and pending-request IDs) lives in
//! [`AuthServiceState`], which the handlers extract via `FromRef`.
//!
//! # Where the cryptography and wire format live
//!
//! - **Signing/verification (XML-DSig) and decryption (XML-Enc)** are delegated to
//!   the pure-Rust `bergshamra-*` crates via the thin [`saml::crypto`] adapter.
//! - **The signature/digest/c14n/encryption algorithms (§9.1/§9.3) are fixed in
//!   the `templates/saml/*.xml` askama templates**, not in Rust constants, so the
//!   templates are the source of truth for the wire format of outgoing messages.
//!
//! # Notable, deliberate design choices
//!
//! - **Verification keys come only from verified metadata (§9.2).** A signature's
//!   `KeyInfo` (`KeyName`/`X509Certificate`) is used solely to *select* a trusted
//!   cert from the RD descriptor, never as the trust root itself.
//! - **The inner Assertion is not verified by its own signature.** Its authenticity
//!   comes from the enveloping RD signature on the ArtifactResponse (verified in
//!   [`saml::validation::validate_artifact_response_at`]) plus binding the Assertion
//!   `Issuer` to the RD EntityID, matching the TVS reference impl `minvws/nl-rdo-max`.
//!   Signatures inside an Assertion/`Advice` are treated as evidence only (§9.1).
